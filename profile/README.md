The Virtual Commons is an open software initiative hosted at [Arizona State University](https://www.asu.edu) that focuses on the development of dynamic computational experiments to analyze and better understand collective action issues. Sharing common resources has been a challenge for human societies for millennia. In many circumstances, the ability to create [effective institutional arrangements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elinor_Ostrom#Design_principles_for_Common_Pool_Resource_(CPR)_institution) has helped us avoid the [tragedy of the commons](https://complexity.asu.edu/tragedy-commons-conventional-wisdom-sustainability-education). [Controlled experiments](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1183532) are an important part of the scientific repertoire to help us increase our understanding of how people successfully organize themselves in cooperative arrangements.
